write the most bay area sentence possible

[1] ASSISTANT:
Here's a sentence that captures the essence of the Bay Area:

"As I sipped a pour-over coffee at a trendy cafe in Haight-Ashbury, I pondered the tech startup I was about to pitch in Silicon Valley, while simultaneously worrying about the housing market and the next Warriors game."

This sentence incorporates several quintessential Bay Area elements:
- **Haight-Ashbury**: Known for its historical significance in the 1960s counterculture movement.
- **Pour-over coffee**: Reflects the Bay Area's vibrant coffee culture.
- **Tech startup**: References the region's status as a hub for technology and innovation.
- **Silicon Valley**: The heart of the tech industry.
- **Housing market**: Acknowledges the area's notoriously high cost of living.
- **Warriors game**: Mentions the Golden State Warriors, a beloved local sports team.
```

## Options

```bash
--debug          Enable debug logs to stderr
--token string   Perplexity API token (env PERPLEXITY_API_TOKEN)
```

## Examples

Generate amusing AI content:

```bash
$ plexctl get "Write a haiku about debugging Go code"
Nil pointers hide
Goroutines sleep at dawn
Context canceled
```

Get concise answers to technical questions:

```bash
$ plexctl get "What's the difference between channels and mutexes in Go?"
Channels are for communication between goroutines, enabling safe data passing with built-in synchronization, while mutexes control access to shared resources by allowing only one goroutine to access the protected section at a time.
```

Have fun with creative prompts:

```bash
$ plexctl get "Write the most tech bro sentence ever"
Just crushed a 5-hour Zoom marathon from my WeWork hot desk, optimized my biohacking stack with nootropics from my YC-backed subscription box, then closed a $10M seed round for my Web3 SaaS platform that's basically Uber for NFTs, all before my afternoon Peloton session and ceremonial microdose.
